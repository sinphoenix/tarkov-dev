Their primary behavior is patrolling but they will often take defensive positions on rooftops and use emplaced weapons. They will target all players who enter their area but are slightly more lenient towards USEC PMCs and Scavs. Rogues can also spawn at the Southern lighthouse location (island). Rogues are extremely dangerous due to their high health, laserbeam accuracy, and high targeting distance. Rogues will also run behind cover and use meds if they are wounded.",

Scav raiders also patrol in multiple groups and can usually be distinguished by their gear, unique voicelines, and general aggression. Scav Raiders start out friendly to all other Scavs (including player scavs) but they will become hostile if you get to close and ignore their verbal warnings.
